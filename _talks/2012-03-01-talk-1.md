Post-quantum Cryptography (PQC) is an umbrella term for cryptographic schemes based on hard mathematical problems which are resistant to attacks by quantum computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a PQC standardisation process in 2017, with a total of 4 algorithms selected for standardisation after round 3 and 4 undertaken for further analysis in Round 4 in 2022. PQC schemes on hardware devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), show the potential of higher throughput performance, for comparable security, at the cost of high area and power consumption. The major aim of this thesis is to help facilitate the global transition to a post quantum secure set of security protocols. This thesis will focus on the optimisation of the the hardware architectures to improve the computational speed and reduce the area overhead. The side channel analysis vulnerabilities and their countermeasures will also be studied.
