I'm a second year PhD student from [The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology,ECIT](https://www.qub.ac.uk/ecit/)), Queen's University Belfast, UK. My research interest includes hardware security, post-quantum cryptography, and side channel attack.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. MÃ¡ire O'Neill](https://www.qub.ac.uk/ecit/People/ProfessorMaireONeill/) and [Dr. Ayesha Khalid](https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/Study/PostgraduateResearch/find-a-phd-supervisor/dr-ayesha-khalid.html). 

I completed my master's degree under the supervision of [Prof. Weiqiang Liu](http://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/lwq/en/), School of Electronic Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China.
