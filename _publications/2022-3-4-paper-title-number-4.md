excerpt: 'In this brief, we proposed a SIKE accelerator with optimized multiplier and adder designs achieving the lowest area-time (AT) product with high operating frequency. The proposed SIKE accelerator for four different security levels has the highest frequency of 303.0-322.5 MHz with 4.0-21.0% improved AT in comparison to the state-of-the-art designs.'

This brief proposed a SIKE architecture with an optimized three-stage pipelined systolic array Montgomery multiplier conforming to SIKE prime’s structure, in combination with a four-stage pipelined adder design. The optimized multiplier reduces the number of DSPs by efficiently utilizing its maximum capability whereas the adder is designed using the carry-compact adder (CCA) architecture attaining the frequency of multiplier, i.e., 310–340 MHz on Virtex-7 for four different security levels of SIKE. The overall architecture of SIKE achieved an improved performance given by the area-time (AT) product metric, which is 4.0-21.0% than the state-of-the-art designs, achieving 303.0-322.5 MHz in frequency. Our proposed SIKE accelerator provide a good trade-off between resource consumption and performance.
