excerpt: 'In this paper, we reconstruct the systolic array based Montgomery multiplier architecture for SIKE, using a three-stage pipeline that results in frequency improvement of 21.4%. The proposed multiplier consumed fewer DSP resources than the state-of-the-art SIKE designs and has a speed increase up to 12.7%.'

This work proposed an improved systolic array Montgomery multiplier for SIKE. The new multiplier uses three-stage pipeline architecture, which reduces the critical path of the multiplier and improves the frequency. In addition, the improved Montgomery multiplication algorithm reduces the DSP by nearly 1/4 and consumes less resources than the state-ofthe-art multiplication of SIKE.
